## Personal reflections on the project
I think the time I spent doing this project was when a lot of things "clicked" for me, I started thinking and visualizing in ways that I had only wanted to before, but now I was doing it. After reading throught he course section on building the chat app, everything kept falling into place after place, with small errors along the way that were easily fixed with a line or two of code I hadn't thought of before. Creating two screens, adding buttons and click functionality was a really good way of imbedded these methods into me and ones I won't soon forget. Adding permissions, and database was also really interesting to implement because as a smartphone user and now novice developer, I want my end-users to knnow that they're the ones in control of their device and what my app can do. It's great for privacy and getting people to be anadvocate for your app, which of course is a nice thing to have. This project, behind the pokedex app, is my favorite - never would I have it would be me (with a little help from lovely people) could build somehting like this.
